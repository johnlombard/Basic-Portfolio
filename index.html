                    <p id="about-me-info1">Hi! My name is John, and if I'm not coding or studying finance, you can find me surfing or hiking. I
                        always enjoy a goodread, and am always open for suggestions. I attended University of North Carolina-Wilmington.
                        North Carolina will alwaus have a place in my heart. I was born in the Philadelphia area, and look
                        to establish a career here.
                    </p>


                    <p>I recently started coding, but have been interested ever since I was introduced to a programmer on Wall
                        Street who said his job was to put his co-workers out of a job. Sometime the truth hurts, but having
                        technology skills has become a necessity in achieving your goals.</p>

                    <p>I'm a naturally curious person, and love to learn many a different things. In the future, I hope to learn
                        the craft of shaping surfboards. I also enjoy challenging myself physically as well as mentally.
                        In the near future, I intend on embarking on my greatest challenge of biking across the country.
                        Wrightsville Beach, NC to Haystack Rock, OR. Only 3,300 miles! Please join me!
